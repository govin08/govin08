- 🚴‍I enjoy bicycling, running, playing games and reading old novels.
- 🎲 I’m interested in all kind of mathematics from the elementary level.
  - refer to [an article about orthogonal diagonalization (linear algebra)](https://govin08.github.io/mathematics/diagonalization/).
  - refer to [an article about dual space (linear algebra)](https://govin08.github.io/mathematics/dual_space/).
  - refer to [an article about basic probability](https://govin08.github.io/mathematics/kocw_stats/).
- 📚 I’ve been studying machine learning and deep learning since January 2020.
  - Stock prediction using LSTM and Wavelet (2020)
  - [Calculating the Lipschitz constant of ML algorithms (2022)](https://github.com/govin08/Lipschitz_Constant_of_DNN/blob/main/0706_Lipschitz_Constant.pdf)
  - Participation in a competition about manufacturing data (2022)

- 👩‍🚀 Working
  - I was looking for jobs as data scientist or AI researcher which involves many mathetmatics (~ 2023. 5.).
  - I was an ML engineer working in [Tilda](https://www.tilda.co.kr/) (2023. 5 ~ 2023. 8).
  - Now I'm working for [UI networks](https://www.uinetworks.co.kr/) (2023. 9 ~ ).
