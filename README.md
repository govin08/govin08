### Hello👋

Hi, I'm SunJoong Kim, a data scientist majored in math.
- 🚴‍I enjoy bicycling, running, playing games and reading old novels.
- 🌱 Education
  - Undergraduate
    - I graduated from Korea university majoring in math (2015. 2, undergraduate).
    - I liked analysis, set theory, elementary algebra and elementary differential geometry.
  - Graduate school
    - I graduated from Korea university majoring in math (2024. 2, [master](https://github.com/govin08/Lipschitz_Constant_of_DNN/blob/main/Lipschitz_constant_of_neural_networks.pdf)).
    - [Professor Oh](https://www.youtube.com/@seungsangoh9923), my supervisor, has a profound understanding of deep learning even though he majored in topology.
- 🎲 Mathematics
  - I’m interested in all kind of mathematics from the elementary level.
  - Refer to my articles about
    - [orthogonal diagonalization (linear algebra)](https://govin08.github.io/mathematics/diagonalization/).
    - [dual space (linear algebra)](https://govin08.github.io/mathematics/dual_space/).
    - [basic probability](https://govin08.github.io/mathematics/kocw_stats/).
    - [Lagrange_multiplier_method](https://govin08.github.io/mathematics/lagrange_multiplier/).
- 🔎 Artificial Inteligence
  - I’ve been studying machine learning and deep learning since (2020. 1).
  - Stock prediction using LSTM and Wavelet (2020. 7 ~ 11)
  - [Calculating the Lipschitz constant of ML algorithms](https://github.com/govin08/Lipschitz_Constant_of_DNN/blob/main/Lipschitz_constant_of_neural_networks.pdf), (2022, master's thesis)
  - Participation in a competition about manufacturing data (2022. 11)
  - [Participation in a competition about recommendation system (2022. 12)](https://coldnoodlesoup.wixsite.com/nextai/post/2022-유플러스-ai-ground)
  - [Suggesting the new SOCAR zone (aiffelthon, 2023. 1)](https://govin08.github.io/machine_learning/socar_zones/)
- 👩‍🚀 Working
  - I worked as a private tutor teaching math to highschool and middle school students (2014 ~ 2019).
  - I was looking for jobs as data scientist or AI researcher which involves many mathetmatics (2023. 4 ~ 5).
  - I worked as an ML engineer in [Tilda](https://www.tilda.co.kr/) (2023. 5 ~ 8).
  - Now I'm working for [UI networks](https://www.uinetworks.co.kr/) (2023. 9 ~ ).
- 🖨 TeX and LaTeX
  - I'm also interested in typseting or rendering mathematical equations to create math documents or webpages.
  - Participated in LaTeX study group with professor [Kim](https://kupress.com/writers/%EA%B9%80%EC%98%81%EC%9A%B1/) and [Yang](https://mathematicians.korea.ac.kr/sdyang/) (2011 ~ 2013 winters)
  - I made the [thesis and dissertation templete](https://github.com/govin08/thesis_templete) for graduate school of Korea University. (2022. 12)
  - I wrote [an article about how to use `mathjax` in `Jekyll`](https://govin08.github.io/mathematics/mathjax/) (2023. 3)
- 📚 Books
  - I really like reading old novel and I've read at least 3 books by each of these authors:
  - Thomas Hardy, Virginia Woolf, William Shakespeare
  - Guy de Maupassant, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre
  - Hermann Hesse, Peter Handke
  - Fyodor Dostoevsky, Leo Tolstoy
  - Milan Kundera
  - Osamu Dazai
