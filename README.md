### Hello👋

Hi, I'm SunJoong Kim, a data scientist majored in math.
- 🚴‍I enjoy bicycling, running, playing games and reading old novels.
- 🌱 Education
  - Undergraduate
    - I graduated from Korea university majored in math (2015. 2, undergraduate).
    - I liked analysis, set theory, elementary algebra and elementary differential geometry.
  - Graduate school
    - I graduated from Korea university majored in math (2024. 2, [master's thesis](https://github.com/govin08/Lipschitz_Constant_of_DNN/blob/main/Lipschitz_constant_of_neural_networks.pdf)).
    - [Professor Oh](https://www.youtube.com/@seungsangoh9923), my supervisor, has a profound understanding about deep learning even though he majored in topology.
- 🎲 Mathematics
  - I’m interested in all kind of mathematics from the elementary level.

- 👩‍🚀 Working
  - I taught mathematics to highschool and middle school students as a private teacher (2014 ~ 2018).
  - I studied in the graduate school (2019. 9 ~ 2024. 2)
  - I worked as an ML engineer in [Tilda](https://www.tilda.co.kr/) (2023. 5 ~ 8).
  - I worked as a data scientist in [UI networks](https://www.uinetworks.co.kr/) (2023. 9 ~ 2024. 10).
  - Now I'm working for [EC miner](http://ecminer.com/) (2025. 8 ~ ).
- 🖨 TeX and LaTeX
  - I'm also interested in typseting or rendering mathematical equations to create math documents or webpages.
  - Participated in LaTeX study group with professor [Kim](https://kupress.com/writers/%EA%B9%80%EC%98%81%EC%9A%B1/) and [Yang](https://mathematicians.korea.ac.kr/sdyang/) (2011 ~ 2013 winters)
  - I made the [thesis and dissertation template](https://github.com/govin08/thesis_template) for graduate school of Korea University. (2022. 12)
  - I wrote [an article about how to use `mathjax` in `Jekyll`](https://govin08.github.io/mathematics/mathjax/) (2023. 3)
- 📚 Reading Books
  - I really like reading old novel and I've read at least three books by each of below authors:
  - Somerset Maugham, Thomas Hardy, Virginia Woolf, William Shakespeare
  - Guy de Maupassant, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre
  - Hermann Hesse, Peter Handke
  - Fyodor Dostoevsky, Leo Tolstoy
