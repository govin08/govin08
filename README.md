### Hello👋

Hi, I'm SunJoong Kim, a data scientist majored in Math.
- 🚴‍I enjoy bicycling, running, playing games and reading old novels.
- 🌱 Education
  - I’m currently a graduate student of Korea university majoring in math.
  - I'm expected to graduate with [master's degree](https://github.com/govin08/Lipschitz_Constant_of_DNN/blob/main/Lipschitz_constant_of_neural_networks.pdf) in February 2024.
  - [Professor Oh](https://www.youtube.com/@seungsangoh9923), my supervisor, has a profound understanding of deep learning even though he majored in topology.
- 🎲 I’m interested in all kind of mathematics from the elementary level.
  - refer to [an article about orthogonal diagonalization (linear algebra)](https://govin08.github.io/mathematics/diagonalization/).
  - refer to [an article about dual space (linear algebra)](https://govin08.github.io/mathematics/dual_space/).
  - refer to [an article about basic probability](https://govin08.github.io/mathematics/kocw_stats/).
- 📚 I’ve been studying machine learning and deep learning since January 2020.
  - Stock prediction using LSTM and Wavelet (2020)
  - [Calculating the Lipschitz constant of ML algorithms (2022)](https://github.com/govin08/Lipschitz_Constant_of_DNN/blob/main/0706_Lipschitz_Constant.pdf)
  - Participation in a competition about manufacturing data (2022)
  - [Participation in a competition about recommendation system (2022)](https://coldnoodlesoup.wixsite.com/nextai/post/2022-유플러스-ai-ground)
  - [Suggesting the new SOCAR zone (aiffelthon, 2023)](https://govin08.github.io/machine_learning/socar_zones/)
- 👩‍🚀 Working
  - I was looking for jobs as data scientist or AI researcher which involves many mathetmatics (2023. 2 ~ 2023. 5).
  - I worked as an ML engineer in [Tilda](https://www.tilda.co.kr/) (2023. 5 ~ 2023. 8).
  - Now I'm working for [UI networks](https://www.uinetworks.co.kr/) (2023. 9 ~ ).
- 🖨 I'm also interested in typseting or rendering mathematical equations to create math documents or webpages.
  - Participated in LaTeX study group with professor [Kim](https://kupress.com/writers/%EA%B9%80%EC%98%81%EC%9A%B1/) and [Yang](https://mathematicians.korea.ac.kr/sdyang/) (2011 ~ 2013 winters)
